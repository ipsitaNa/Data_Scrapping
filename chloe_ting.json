YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs.

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.",

You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.",

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you.",

YouTubers optimise their video's meta data for discovery due to how the algorithm is like. This isn't anything new. Most people who've been watching YouTube for years would understand this. If you're unhappy and get triggered by this, well, this channel isn't for you then. I\u2019ve provided free workout schedules and programs since day 1 and have always optimised my meta data as such so that's not going to change.\n\nHaving said that, it doesn't mean the workout do not work. You will still see results by following a suitable program schedule, watching your diet, being in a deficit or surplus (based on your goals), doing exercises in good form, etc. These are all equally important factors. You're not going to get abs, grow a booty, grow biceps magically from 1 or 2 videos, in 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks cause everyone is different. A title may come close to suggesting that, but I've explain multiple times throughout videos throughout my channel over years that it takes time and lots of factors, so don't take a video title out of context. Targetting fat loss is also not scientifically proven. Everyone is different and it takes time. \n\nWhen doing any home workouts, do take precaution to exercise in a safe environment, and if you need help or you're not seeing results, I suggest seeing a health and fitness professional to give you tailored advice on your exercise form and dietary needs. I am not a medical professional and what I share on my channel are my views and what has worked for myself. Your health and safety is the utmost importance so find out what works for you."

Enjoy the video and regarding the Australian bushfires, it's still going on and reality is that the scale of this is a lot bigger than what most people think.

In order to heal up, I'm going to be eating healthy really well so I heal up from the inside as well as from the outside. \n\nSo here's 3 healthy recipes that I've recently put together recently that you can try out. A healthy matcha parfait, pad thai noodles, and steamed barramundi! \n\nAlso, the fish sauce I mentioned is from a brand called Red Boat Fish Sauce.

In order to heal up, I'm going to be eating healthy really well so I heal up from the inside as well as from the outside. \n\nSo here's 3 healthy recipes that I've recently put together recently that you can try out. A healthy matcha parfait, pad thai noodles, and steamed barramundi! \n\nAlso, the fish sauce I mentioned is from a brand called Red Boat Fish Sauce. Its on Amazon so I think it can be found fairly easily.\n\n\u2606Help subtitle this video\u2606\nhttp://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=LjraNvyrg-M\n\n\u2606Sponsor this channel\u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/chloeting/join\n\u2606Sub to my 2nd channel\u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBrcDabYtwbR1VIhwH5efZA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2606My Instagram links\u2606\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chloe_t/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/itschloeting/\n\n\u2606Music by\u2606\nJordyn Edmonds - Nobody Else\n\n#whatieat #healthyrecipes #chloeting"

Having said that, I love girls with big and muscly thighs too!\n\n\u2606FREE 30 Day Lean Thigh Challenge Program \u2606\nEpisode 1 - This Video!\nEpisode 2 - https://youtu.be/hzuSvsu5hIU\nEpisode 3 - https://youtu.be/KRS57hx3o6E\nEpisode 4 - https://youtu.be/a3gaS8gz1aw\nEpisode 5 - Releasing on 28th March\nFULL SCHEDULE: https://www.chloeting.com/program\n\n\u2606Help Subtitle this video\u2606\nhttp://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=qH1e8HYEDCQ\n\n\u2606Sponsor this channel\u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/chloeting/join\n\u2606Sub to my 2nd channel\u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBrcDabYtwbR1VIhwH5efZA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2606Fitness Outfits\u2606\nMy Gymshark Affiliate Link - https://gym.sh/Shop-Chloe-Ting \n\n\u2606My Instagram links\u2606\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chloe_t/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/itschloeting/\n\n\u2606Filmed With\u2606\nPanasonic GH5\nLumix G 8-18mm \nLumix G 12-35mm \nLumix G 42.5mm\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/chloeting\n\n\u2606Music by\u2606\nPewDiePie - Hej Monika (House Remix by Party In Backyard)\n\u25bahttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZy_L2zatvA\n\nBitch Lasagna by Party In Backyard \n\u25bahttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIaIVpEocfuQ9fhBT1rsKrQ\n\nJohnny Johnny by Dylan Locke\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCk5QMQtOsPfi9w6JxktCR9w\nhttps://open.spotify.com/track/4EdnU74w7K5aVX3wf0sRTO?si=wQe2Nx47TI6P1_dxSQLOyQ\n\nLasagna by Dylan Locke\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJO9yLYZAWE\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dylanlocke/lasagna \n\n#workouts #slimlegs #chloeting"

                "description": "I've been suffering from chronic bloating, severe cramps, etc for the longest time. I normally have some sort of stomach cramps after I eat because it expanded so much to the point that it hurts. It has been there since I was a kid and I thought it was normal to feel stomach cramps for the longest time. Sometimes I'll have major cramps to the point that i'll feel like throwing up but still can't throw up because I'm a major wuss, and it'll last all night. \nI have been looking to solve all my health issues once and for all through natural remedies, and with a Naturopathic, Ayurvedic Functional Medicine Doctor - Dr Stephen Cabral who I've consulted with in the last 6 months. This video is part 3 of my journey. \n\nPart 1 - https://youtu.be/yljCu79cFsc\nThis video documents the background of my issues, the test kits I used to discover hard facts about my body, and I talk about the issues that were found. \n\nPart 2 - https://youtu.be/nm8EsGrcSG8\nThe 2nd video touches on my first step to recovery as I undergo a 7 day detox to heal my liver, and detox harmful toxins from my body. This video touches on why it is important to detox, followed by a documentation of my experience on what I consumed for a week, and the end results. A detox is known for various benefits including weight loss, anti-aging and improving general wellbeing.\n\nPart 3 - THIS VIDEO\nThe 3rd video documents my real thoughts and experience going through the gut protocol 2 weeks in and what the bacteria die off symptoms feel like.\n\nAnd the final part 4 will be out some time after the gut protocol and will cover the process, my experience, and most importantly, my end results. Will I finally not suffer from bloating?\n\nPlease know that I'm putting this video together purely for informational purposes. Everyone is different and everyone needs their own professional diagnosis.  I am also not being paid to promote my doctor, I am just hoping to share my experience as many people out there suffer from stomach cramps, bloating and gut issues as well. \n\nIf you're interested in learning more about Dr Cabral, you can read up about him here:-\nhttps://equilibriumnutrition.com/pages/our-story\nhttp://drcabraldetox.com/ \n\nPlease do leave a comment below with questions and I'll try my best to answer all of them.\n\n\u2606Help Subtitle this video\u2606\nhttp://www.youtube.com/timedtext_video?ref=share&v=oD8YLGh--uk\n\n\u2606Sponsor this channel\u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/chloeting/join\n\u2606Sub to my 2nd channel\u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBrcDabYtwbR1VIhwH5efZA?sub_confirmation=1\n\n\u2606Fitness Outfits\u2606\nMy Gymshark Affiliate Link - https://gym.sh/Shop-Chloe-Ting \n\n\u2606My Instagram links\u2606\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chloe_t/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/itschloeting/\n\n\u2606Filmed With\u2606\nPanasonic GH5\nLumix G 8-18mm \nLumix G 12-35mm \nLumix G 42.5mm\nhttps://www.amazon.com/shop/chloeting\n\n#health #naturalremedies #healthupdate",

I didn't do the extreme diets that these kpop stars did, but instead I made a few modifications to it so that I was eating sufficient and well. I actually did this diet more than 3 weeks ago now and i did it for a duration of a week.\n\nThere was a lot of footage filmed over a week and a lot of commentary I had to condense so just to iterate the main point of this video is that extreme kpop diets are DANGEROUS. You do not need to go to extreme measures to lose weight. If you watch the video to the end, you can see the weight I loss even though I ate in much higher quantities than them, but yet was still able to lose weight, and on top of that, I didn't risk damaging my metabolism or going into a yoyo diet effect after it ended. Going to extreme measures in extreme kpop diets will do your body more harm than good.\n\nI lost more than 1kg in 2 days because of of all the water weight disappearing during the first couple of days, then after that it was a little bit more water weight and fat. \n\nI highly recommend anyone who's having trouble or have questions with dieting to see a dietitian as it's important to get professional help. I don't think these kpop diets like the IU diet, SNSD diet, or Jimin diet are sustainable and are extremely risky to your body. \n\nDo watch on to see my before and after weight in and results, and leave a comment below on what you think.\n\n\u2606Outfit\u2606\nGymshark - http://gym.sh/Shop-Chloe-Ting\n\n\u2606Workout from this video\u2606\nhttps://youtu.be/-q9oe-koIVs\n\n\u2606My second Youtube Channel - VLOGS & OTHER NON FITNESS VIDEOS \u2606\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBrcDabYtwbR1VIhwH5efZA\n\n\u2606My Instagram links\u2606\nhttps://www.instagram.com/chloe_t/\nhttps://www.instagram.com/itschloeting/\n\n\u2606Music by\u2606\nBlue Wednesday - Hot Butta\nhttps://soundcloud.com/bluewednesday\n\nDJ Quads - Dope\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads\n\n#diet #kpopdiet #weightloss",

Chop up some avocado and add the chicken tenderoin. You can heat up your chicken tenderloins before serving.\n\nRecipe 2 - Chicken with Sweet potatoes, Quinoa and capsicums\nFor this recipe. I like to readdress that my quinoa is cooked with some grass fed butter and salt. Sometimes I add herbs, hot sauce, or lemon. I change it up quite a bit. Quinoa is quite tasteless on its own so you'll need to season it!\n\nRecipe 3 - Sardines with Zucchini Noodles\nThese sardines are cooked with tomato paste. I just add a bit of water to heat it up so its more saucy. Remember to add salt as well!\n\nRecipe 4 - Quinoa Salad Bowl\nYou can use any proteins you like. Add all your favourite vegetables. Add some lemon juice, or balsamic vinegar, or oil. Make sure you add some sort of dressing! It will be quite plain without any dressings\n\nRecipe 5 - Zucchini Noodles with Chicken.\nI personally like to have this with pesto. You can just buy those from the groceries so you don't have to make them if you are a very busy person! If not you can try this avocado dressing. \nI have half an avocado, a lemon, olive oil, salt and hot sauce in there. Just process it. You can add some herbs and nuts as well so it's even more tasty!\n\nThat's all the recipes. The ingredients are all really easy to prep. Those are my take to prepping my ingredients. You can make teriyaki chicken, or lemon and herb chicken. Change it up so you don't get bored! \n\nHope you enjoy!",

Missing all the Japan snacks, and Niseko restaurants.\n\nThis explains why I felt sick the first week back in Melbourne. lol.\n\nMusic by:\nEngelwood:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/engelwoodmusic\nhttps://engelwood.bandcamp.com/\n\nDJ Quads:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads\n\nRelated Videos:\nMy 2017 Japan Winter Lookbook - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCrV5ctPL_4\nMY 2016 Japan Winter Lookbook - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ab-cMUimnlQ\nMy 2016 Japan Travel Diary - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gXIAoaWV8g"

                "description": "Wearing Energy Seamless Set. Shop here: http://gym.sh/Shop-Chloe-Ting\nThis is a pretty intense fat burning full body workout. This will burn heaps of calories if you're trying your best. \n\nDon't worry if you can't do it as fast as I am in this video. If you had a break from working out, then it'll take some time to get used to intense workouts again. I personally had a break and find it hard to keep up with my workouts. This workout was filmed before I left to Japan so I was in better shape at that time as well! I hope you try this workout out and if you can't do any of these exercises, you can replace it with jumping jacks, or high knees, or even jog in place to keep the heart rate up.\n\nHope you had a great holiday and happy new year! Let's smash the new year with a brand new workout! \n\nMusic by:\nElektronomia - Fire - https://youtu.be/mX-SktWVHao\nElektronomia - Disco Boy - https://youtu.be/8_eDiZCVyR4\nElektronomia - united - https://youtu.be/EgXcda1SzxU\n\nTrack: Elektronomia - The Other Side [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nWatch: https://youtu.be/odThebFOFVg\nFree Download / Stream: http://ncs.io/TheOtherSideYO\n\nSong: Elektronomia & JJD - Free [NCS Release] \nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nVideo: https://youtu.be/9Va88Kt0NN0\nLink: http://ncs.io/Free\n\nSong: Elektronomia - Limitless [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nVideo: https://youtu.be/cNcy3J4x62M\nLink: http://ncs.io/Elimitless",

                    "description": "Wearing Energy Seamless Set. Shop here: http://gym.sh/Shop-Chloe-Ting\nThis is a pretty intense fat burning full body workout. This will burn heaps of calories if you're trying your best. \n\nDon't worry if you can't do it as fast as I am in this video. If you had a break from working out, then it'll take some time to get used to intense workouts again. I personally had a break and find it hard to keep up with my workouts. This workout was filmed before I left to Japan so I was in better shape at that time as well! I hope you try this workout out and if you can't do any of these exercises, you can replace it with jumping jacks, or high knees, or even jog in place to keep the heart rate up.\n\nHope you had a great holiday and happy new year! Let's smash the new year with a brand new workout! \n\nMusic by:\nElektronomia - Fire - https://youtu.be/mX-SktWVHao\nElektronomia - Disco Boy - https://youtu.be/8_eDiZCVyR4\nElektronomia - united - https://youtu.be/EgXcda1SzxU\n\nTrack: Elektronomia - The Other Side [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nWatch: https://youtu.be/odThebFOFVg\nFree Download / Stream: http://ncs.io/TheOtherSideYO\n\nSong: Elektronomia & JJD - Free [NCS Release] \nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nVideo: https://youtu.be/9Va88Kt0NN0\nLink: http://ncs.io/Free\n\nSong: Elektronomia - Limitless [NCS Release]\nMusic provided by NoCopyrightSounds.\nVideo: https://youtu.be/cNcy3J4x62M\nLink: http://ncs.io/Elimitless"

I'm still doing it but I might consider doing 5 days of fasting and 2 days of non fasting days now. \n\nWhat I used in my recipe: Acai powder:\n15% off your first Tropeaka order at https://tropeaka.com \nUse code: CHLOE15  (worldwide shipping available)\n\nOther updates:\n\nI didn't lose my period. I actually had my period in time and for the first time in a year, I didn't have unbearable period pain. I don't know if that's correlated to int fasting or not. I will have let you guys know more about that after a couple of months. \n\nAlso, I started ketogenic diet along with intermittent fasting 3 weeks ago because I wanted to see how I go with it. It is definitely not as easy as doing fasting alone. It is honestly quite challenging at first but i sticked through with it. Definitely don't recommend anyone to go into keto without doing some research and be prepared for it.\n\nAlso forgot to add in the macadamia nuts section to my what i eat section. I consume about 50g of nuts everyday to hit my fat intake. Mostly macadamia with almonds. Almonds is high in potassium and macadamia on the other hand has loads of fat content which is great for keto diet. \n\nCheck out my first intermittent fasting video here:\nhttps://youtu.be/MPKDjNvKnN8\n\nAlso try this full body workout if you want to lose fat and maintain muscle!\nhttps://youtu.be/MPKDjNvKnN8\n\nThis standing abs workout burns heaps of calories as well:\nhttps://youtu.be/M6b37hswcks\n\nI hope you enjoy today's video.

                "description": "This full body workout is quite challenging but it is definitely THE WORKOUT that you must try if you want to lose those love handles, back fat and all that! It burns over 200 calories easily. For me it burns 250 calories that's because I'm quite petite and small. If you are taller than me (including doing it in high intensity) you will burn much more. For men... you guys will burn more than 300 calories EASILY! 360 is a moderate number for you men out there! You guys can get definitely more out of this!\n\nHope you enjoy this workout. Also, don't give up. It is hard at first but it will get easier. You will need to build your strength over time and also your stamina. I can do pretty intense workout because my heart can handle it. If you can't then tone it down and slowly build it up. If there's any exercises that you can't do in this workout, then do it more slowly and challenge yourself to work harder the next session! YOU CAN DO IT!",

I actually did 30 minutes of this (4 sets each circuit). If you're up for the challenge, try it too if you want those lean legs!\n\nI really love this routine. I'm going to be doing this every week since I'm also trying to lean down at the moment.\n\nHope you enjoy the workout.

This low-impact full body cardio workout is definitely more intense than the first ' No Jumping' Workout but it is still doable. If you want to burn some calories, try this one out! Definitely a fun one. Join me with my weight loss journey! :D\n\nIf you watch my what i eat in a week video, you'd know that I'm trying to lose some fat. I want to be lean again. I store most of my fat on my back, my love handles, my thighs and my butt so that's why it is not exactly very obvious because they're mostly covered by my clothing! haha.

This low-impact full body cardio workout is definitely more intense than the first ' No Jumping' Workout but it is still doable. If you want to burn some calories, try this one out! Definitely a fun one. Join me with my weight loss journey! :D\n\nIf you watch my what i eat in a week video, you'd know that I'm trying to lose some fat. I want to be lean again. I store most of my fat on my back, my love handles, my thighs and my butt so that's why it is not exactly very obvious because they're mostly covered by my clothing! haha. I hope you enjoy this workout because I LOVED IT!\n\nMUSIC:\nElectro-Light - Symbolism [NCS Release]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__CRWE-L45k\nElectro-Light SoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/maskedacoustic"

Add Broccoli and cook for another 5 minutes until broccoli is tender.\n\n\nChicken Soup Recipe (my momma recipe)\n-------\n1 Free Range Chicken\n1/4 cup of Goji Berries\n1-2 Tablespoon of Sesame Oil\n100g of Fresh Ginger\nOptional: Rice Wine/Red Wine\nOptional: Red Dates\nOptional: White Fungus\n\nCook the ginger with sesame oil until fragrant, then add the chicken. Brown the chicken then add boiling water, just covering the chicken.\nLet it simmer for around 20 minutes, add Goji Berries and simmer for another 10 minutes. You can also add rice wine if you like it. My mom usually add loads of her home made rice wine, but I don't have it here.

You can also add bacon, sausage, or other vegetables. Adjust to you liking. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to an oiled tray (I used olive oil). Then bake for 20-25 minutes (or more if you have more ingredients) at 180 degree celsius /355 degree fahrenheit.\n\n\u2606 Overnight oats\nThe standard recipes is:\n1/2 cup rolled oats\n1 cup milk (almond milk)\nCinnamon\nMaple Syrup\nBerries\n1 tsp Vanilla extract\n\nAdjust to your liking!\n\n\u2606 Lunch & Dinner\n\n\u2022 3 Large sweet potatoes\nI like it to cut them into chip size because it cooks faster. It takes about 20-30 minutes at 200 degree celsius. Flip them over after the first 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\u2022 2 Large Red capsicums and 2 Yellow Capsicums (Bell Peppers)\nTakes about 20 minutes at 200 degree celsius to cook to my liking. You can leave it in the oven a little shorter if you like it crunchy. (200 degree celsius us around 390 degree fahrenheit)\n\n\u2022 3 Bunch of Asparagus. \nThis takes less than 10 minutes at 200 degree celsius. If they're small and tiny then 5 minutes will do. I like them crunchy.\n\n\u2022 Kale with Garlic\nAdd some to a pan and fry the garlic for a minute then add the kale. Cook for about 5 minutes and done!\n\n\u2022 2 big Salmon Fillets\nSeason with salt and pepper (that's all I do). You can add your favourite seasonings.\nGrill it for 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degree celsius. I don't like them overdone. and 9-10 minutes are normally just right depending on the thickness.\n\n\u2022 2 big White Fish Fillets\nRubbed some olive oil on the fish. Half a lemon juice, Ginger powder, salt, pepper and oregano. \nGrill it for 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degree celsius.\n\n\u2022 1kg of Chicken Breasts\nRubbed some olive oil on the chicken. Season with sweet paprika, salt, pepper and garlic granules. Again add your fav spices!\nGrill it for 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degree celsius. Again this is dependent on the thickness of the chicken breast. I had mine sliced in half.\n\nAfter all these are cooked, I just divide the chicken breasts into 5 portions. Add sweet potatoes, capsicums and asparagus to create 5 chicken/veg meals.\n\nFor the fish meals, I have quinoa, kale and the fish. I didn't measure anything so I just eyeball everything here. For white fish, I added more sweet potatoes because white fish are lower in fat, hence lower in calories. \n\n\n\u2606 Healthy Hummus\n2 cans of chickpeas (500g drained chickpeas)\n20g of tahinis\n60g of olive oil\n2 garlic cloves\n1 Lemon Juice\nAlmond milk to water it down. (Just add enough so that it's not too thick)\nPink Himalayan Salt\nCumin (optional)\n\nBlend them all together! I like to eat it with Wholemeal Pita Pockets. It is sooooo good. The ones I love most is from Mission.\n\nDon't forget to add some fruits or nuts as snacks if you're hungry. Also don't restrict too much. Need ice cream, have some ice cream. Don't overindulge and also don't under indulge. Stay happy and healthy.\n\nThat's all! I hope you find this video helpful!",

You can also add bacon, sausage, or other vegetables. Adjust to you liking. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mixture to an oiled tray (I used olive oil). Then bake for 20-25 minutes (or more if you have more ingredients) at 180 degree celsius /355 degree fahrenheit.\n\n\u2606 Overnight oats\nThe standard recipes is:\n1/2 cup rolled oats\n1 cup milk (almond milk)\nCinnamon\nMaple Syrup\nBerries\n1 tsp Vanilla extract\n\nAdjust to your liking!\n\n\u2606 Lunch & Dinner\n\n\u2022 3 Large sweet potatoes\nI like it to cut them into chip size because it cooks faster. It takes about 20-30 minutes at 200 degree celsius. Flip them over after the first 10 to 15 minutes.\n\n\u2022 2 Large Red capsicums and 2 Yellow Capsicums (Bell Peppers)\nTakes about 20 minutes at 200 degree celsius to cook to my liking. You can leave it in the oven a little shorter if you like it crunchy. (200 degree celsius us around 390 degree fahrenheit)\n\n\u2022 3 Bunch of Asparagus. \nThis takes less than 10 minutes at 200 degree celsius. If they're small and tiny then 5 minutes will do. I like them crunchy.\n\n\u2022 Kale with Garlic\nAdd some to a pan and fry the garlic for a minute then add the kale. Cook for about 5 minutes and done!\n\n\u2022 2 big Salmon Fillets\nSeason with salt and pepper (that's all I do). You can add your favourite seasonings.\nGrill it for 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degree celsius. I don't like them overdone. and 9-10 minutes are normally just right depending on the thickness.\n\n\u2022 2 big White Fish Fillets\nRubbed some olive oil on the fish. Half a lemon juice, Ginger powder, salt, pepper and oregano. \nGrill it for 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degree celsius.\n\n\u2022 1kg of Chicken Breasts\nRubbed some olive oil on the chicken. Season with sweet paprika, salt, pepper and garlic granules. Again add your fav spices!\nGrill it for 10 minutes in the oven at 200 degree celsius. Again this is dependent on the thickness of the chicken breast. I had mine sliced in half.\n\nAfter all these are cooked, I just divide the chicken breasts into 5 portions. Add sweet potatoes, capsicums and asparagus to create 5 chicken/veg meals.\n\nFor the fish meals, I have quinoa, kale and the fish. I didn't measure anything so I just eyeball everything here. For white fish, I added more sweet potatoes because white fish are lower in fat, hence lower in calories. \n\n\n\u2606 Healthy Hummus\n2 cans of chickpeas (500g drained chickpeas)\n20g of tahinis\n60g of olive oil\n2 garlic cloves\n1 Lemon Juice\nAlmond milk to water it down. (Just add enough so that it's not too thick)\nPink Himalayan Salt\nCumin (optional)\n\nBlend them all together! I like to eat it with Wholemeal Pita Pockets. It is sooooo good. The ones I love most is from Mission.\n\nDon't forget to add some fruits or nuts as snacks if you're hungry. Also don't restrict too much. Need ice cream, have some ice cream. Don't overindulge and also don't under indulge. Stay happy and healthy.\n\nThat's all! I hope you find this video helpful!"

Sorry if it's a little short, I spent a lot of time enjoying the snow while I was there and spending quality time with my parents who I don't get to see often. A lot of you have asked me several times about my camera equipment in comments/direct msgs, I've listed them below. The snowboarding scenes were filmed with the Sony FDR-X3000 Action Cam which is awesome cause of it's image stabilisation and their batteries do extremely well considering it was -15 degrees up there. Leave a comment below with questions or just to say hi!\n\n\u25ba FILMED USING \u25ba\nMost vlog footage and action scenes filmed using Sony FDR-X3000 Action Cam\nCamera - Sony A7RII\nLens - Sony FE 24-70mm f/2.8 GM Lens | Sony 16-35mm f/4 ZA OSS Lens\nDJI Drone - http://bit.ly/2oAR71M\n\n\u25ba LOCATION \u25ba\nThe first couple of scenes are taken at:\nBiei\nLake Shikaribetsu\nSapporo Winter Festival\nThe rest are at Furano\nPlease leave me a comment if you want to know more about any of these locations.\n\n\u25ba MY LINKS \u25ba\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/chloe_t\nFitness Instagram: http://instagram.com/itschloeting\nBlog: http://www.chloeting.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/chloe_ting\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/itschloeting\nSnapchat: chloe_ting\n\n\u25ba SKI JACKET \u25ba\nSuperdry: http://bit.ly/2m3u9gV\n\n\u25ba MUSIC \u25ba\nTHUGLI - Cold Winter (feat.

But i reckon you can still squat, but only low bar squat and you will need to get it right. You will have to practice it until you feel that you engaged mostly your glutes and hammies and minimal quad activation. Remember these steps:\n1.Your upper body needs to lean slightly more forward when you squat down,\n2. Your butt push back a bit more, \n3. Your knees pointing outwards, \n4. Your toes pointing outwards, \n5. Feet wider than normal squats. \n6. A resistance band will further help you with that which I do use sometimes.\nSo just remember all these steps and you will feel that your squat now do not use much of your quads. If you still feel loads of quad activation, then maybe skip low bar squat as well.\n\nHope you find this helpful!\n\n:D",

Remember to keep clean and hydrate well and also sleep well if you're trying to lose some weight.\n\nHave fun working out. This is a great one for beginners and also if you have been doing quite a bit oh my hiit exercises and want something a bit easier. It tends to be quite hard to get a hang of working out after a break so this is a great start. You can also make it more challenging my doing the reps more quickly so basically do it fast and also big range of motion.

I hope you enjoyed this video. It was challenging to squeeze three weeks of Italy into a 3 minute video but I hope you enjoy watching it. I really enjoyed this trip, met a lot of cool people, ate lots of gelato and pizza, did a couple of cliff jumping and I never thought I could do that, and survived the winding Italian coastal roads. \n\nQuick shout out to Quisisana Hotel (http://www.quisisana.com/) in Capri where I had the best time in Italy.

I hope you enjoyed this video. It was challenging to squeeze three weeks of Italy into a 3 minute video but I hope you enjoy watching it. I really enjoyed this trip, met a lot of cool people, ate lots of gelato and pizza, did a couple of cliff jumping and I never thought I could do that, and survived the winding Italian coastal roads. \n\nQuick shout out to Quisisana Hotel (http://www.quisisana.com/) in Capri where I had the best time in Italy. Read more about my Italy trip on my blog soon.

Finally another workout to burn belly fat! This is a cardio abs workout with 50% full body exercises and 50% abs exercises. The full body exercises require you to use your core as well which is great. Also doing full body workout helps you burn so much more, and your body will still burn while you're at rest. That's the reason why i've combined the exercises. I've explained that somewhere in the video. Basically full body workout like squats, lunges, etc require you to use your leg muscles, and leg muscles are the biggest muscle groups in our body so working these muscles will allow you to burn more calories, even when you are at rest your body will still be burning. \n\nAlso I was going to add moving plank instead of plank twist but i was so awkward doing it so i changed it up. Feel free to change to your favourite plank exercise. You can also always intensify any of these exercises but doing it faster, or do a bigger movement. It was my first time doing it in the video and it was definitely quite intense for me. I felt so good after doing a few sessions and the abs will show! Please do it more consistently if you have lots of belly fat. Give yourself a month or so. But if you have minimal fats, it won't take you long. You can alternate between this exercise and my other intense abs workout. I'll recommend to do 2 or 3 times a week depending on how sore you are too. Muscles definitely need to rest and recover so give yourself a day in between your abs workout!\n\nPlease do try it out and let me know how it goes. This really works for me so I hope it works for you! Please tag your abs/glutes progress #chlofitness on insta! I would love to see your progress\n\n\u25baMusic used:\n\u25baValcos - A New Light [NCS Release]\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_v9WSImGIU\nFollow Valcos\nhttps://soundcloud.com/valcos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/Valcos\n\n\u25baJim Yosef - Forces (feat.

I am currently in Italy so I may be a little late in response but please do leave me a comment so I can get back to it later! \n\nSo for workout days, especially intense workout days. I eat substantial amount of carbs before and after my workout. It is crucial for muscle recovery and also gives you energy before the workout. You want to be able to lift the weights that you want to lift. If you don't have sufficient energy, you won't be able to do that and hence won't be able to build as much muscle. If you're looking to build more muscles then you also need to be on caloric surplus. I am probably on the surplus on this particular day but I haven''t been counting calories recently. I only count calories if I have a goal to reach but I was more to maintaining at this point. So yeah I hope this helps to give you some ideas. These are the days that I really don't have time to cook and so I prep my meals in advance and just heat it up when I want to eat it.\n\nIt is also very important to heat up rice before eating them because they can cause food poisoning. It is best to have fresh rice and for left overs, you'll have to refrigerate it and heat it up the next day, and you shouldn't keep rice for more than a day.

I am currently in Italy so I may be a little late in response but please do leave me a comment so I can get back to it later! \n\nSo for workout days, especially intense workout days. I eat substantial amount of carbs before and after my workout. It is crucial for muscle recovery and also gives you energy before the workout. You want to be able to lift the weights that you want to lift. If you don't have sufficient energy, you won't be able to do that and hence won't be able to build as much muscle. If you're looking to build more muscles then you also need to be on caloric surplus. I am probably on the surplus on this particular day but I haven''t been counting calories recently. I only count calories if I have a goal to reach but I was more to maintaining at this point. So yeah I hope this helps to give you some ideas. These are the days that I really don't have time to cook and so I prep my meals in advance and just heat it up when I want to eat it.\n\nIt is also very important to heat up rice before eating them because they can cause food poisoning. It is best to have fresh rice and for left overs, you'll have to refrigerate it and heat it up the next day, and you shouldn't keep rice for more than a day.

I thought I'll give you a bit more information down here. I normally have quite a good amount of carbs and proteins in the morning. I like to replenish my body in the morning with good nutritious food. I like to combine the food above with some sort of protein if I think it is not substantial for the day. Normally I'll go for eggs to add some protein to my diet.  Boiled eggs are the easiest option.\n\n\u25ba MY LINKS \u25ba\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/chloe_t\nBlog: http://www.chloeting.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/chloe_ting\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/itschloeting\nSnapchat: chloe_ting\n\n\u25baTofu Banana Bread (Sugar Free, Dairy Free, Plant Based) - AWESOME STUFF YO! \u25ba\n\nDry Ingredients:\n1 1/2 cup of oat flour ( I just use my nutribullet to grind my oats up so that it is smooth like an oat meal/flour)\n1/2 cup of lupin flour (this is not a very popular flour but it is so high in protein and fibre)\n1 tps of Baking soda\n1/2 tps of Salt\n\n(You can use whole wheat flour and all purpose flour if you prefer.

I went to Nikoi Island, and also stayed at the main island at Banyan Tree, and The Canopi.  I went at the monsoon time so it was cloudy and rainy at times and that's around July and August.

Here's a fun little travel diary I recorded when I was in Bintan! I've only recently learnt about the place and so it was my first time there! It was honestly such an amazing experience. I went to Nikoi Island, and also stayed at the main island at Banyan Tree, and The Canopi.  I went at the monsoon time so it was cloudy and rainy at times and that's around July and August. I hope you enjoyed this video and please give it a thumbs up if you like it! :D\n\n\u25ba MY Gear \u25ba\nCanon 5dm3 + 24-70mm f2.8\nDJI Drone - http://bit.ly/2oAR71M\n\n\u25ba MY LINKS \u25ba\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/chloe_t\nBlog: http://www.chloeting.com\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/chloe_ting\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/itschloeting\nSnapchat: chloe_ting\n\nPlaces shown in this video:\nNikoi Island: http://bit.ly/2bKfMKF\nTreasure Bay: http://bit.ly/2bBz3iQ\nAir Adventures Bintan: http://bit.ly/2bfwhl5\nBanyan Tree Resort: http://bit.ly/2be464l\nIndonesia Travel: http://bit.ly/2bex1Cw\n\nMUSIC:\nYoe Mase - Nothing More (DEAF KEV Remix)\n\u25ba DEAF KEV\nhttps://soundcloud.com/atm-dubstep\nhttps://www.facebook.com/ATMDubstep\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/ATMDubstep\n\n\u25ba Yoe Mase\nhttps://soundcloud.com/yoemase\nhttps://www.facebook.com/yoemase\nhttps://twitter.com/Yoe_mase"

First of all thank you so so so much for 80k subscribers. I really appreciate all the support! So many of you guys have requested another \"Do it with me\" workout video and so I recorded this little workout yesterday! I was so sore from the my leg workout and also my back/arms/shoulder workout. I really pushed myself at the gym this week! So when I recorded this video, I was like ughh my back and arms are sore, my legs and glutes are sore too. I was like, damn it why did i choose to record it today. lol\n\nSo yeah as I've said in my video (If you didn't watch until the end of the video), a lot of you guys asked me about how to get abs definition, flat stomach, lose belly fats etc, and whether it is sufficient to do my abs exercise routine and get abs definition. It really depends on whether you have much fats around your abdominal area. If you don't have much fats, then you will see the defintion very quickly. But if you have loads of fats, then you have to do some sort of cardio. HIIT cardio is my fav, but you can always opt for running, swimming and etc. Also diet plays a very important  part in getting flat stomach. So try to eat clean!\n\nHope you enjoyed today's video and if you're reading this. Do this exercise with me now! haha love ya.\n\n\u25ba MUSC \u25ba \nFareoh - Cloud Ten [NCS Release]: https://youtu.be/yzirKVtSERU\nFollow Fareoh here:\n\u2022 https://soundcloud.com/fareoh\n\u2022 https://www.facebook.com/Fareoh/\n\u2022 https://twitter.com/thefareoh\n\u2022 https://www.youtube.com/user/official...\n\nItro & Tobu - Cloud 9 [NCS Release]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtKbiyyVZks\nTobu:\nSpotify http://smarturl.it/Tobu_Spotify\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/7obu\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/tobuofficial\nTwitter https://twitter.com/tobuofficial\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/tobuoffi...\nItro:\nSpotify http://open.spotify.com/artist/6fEZjg...\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/officialitro\nTwitter https://twitter.com/itromsc\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/official...\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/itro\n\nJim Yosef & Alex Skrindo - Passion [NCS Release]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pxEKoZKpCew\nJim Yosef\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/jim-yosef\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/jimyosefmusic\nYouTube https://www.youtube.com/user/Jimboows\n\nAlex Skrindo\nSoundCloud https://soundcloud.com/alex-skrindo\nFacebook https://www.facebook.com/AlexanderSkr...\nTwitter https://twitter.com/AlexSkrindo",

Lunges and squats are more of a compound move but the rest are glute focused exercises. Try them out guys! You will definitely see a difference in size.
